# Hero

**FUORI Lab**  
The tamper-evident archive for AI alignment variance.

## Subhead  
When AI behavior drifts from intent, policy, or spec, anecdotes aren't enough. FUORI applies shared criteria, verifies evidence locally, and produces cryptographically sealed records the world can rely on.

## Mandate

**Acceleration demands accountability.**  
AI systems now mediate safety-critical and high-leverage decisions. FUORI's mandate is to convert real-world interactions into defensible recordsâ€”grounded in open criteria, privacy-by-default review, and neutral validation.

---

## Criteria & Accountability

### What qualifies
Our open standard specifies when behavior is _out of bounds_. Initial research-backed categories include:

1. Policy deviation (e.g., violation of published safety policies)  
2. Private or copyrighted data leakage  
3. Unsafe recommendation or action planning  
4. Reward hacking / spec gaming  
5. Regression or refusal loops  
6. Capability jumps (unexpected zero-shot skills)  
7. Emergent persona activation (misaligned internal features)  
8. Multi-agent collusion or sabotage  
9. Quantified high-conflict goal divergence (per misalignment-score models)  

ðŸŽ¯ VISUAL PLACEMENT: **Dynamic Misalignment Heatmap** â€“ Insert an animated heat-map here to show how often each category above occurs over recent time windows. Hovering a cell reveals an anonymised, high-impact example, reinforcing the relevance of the list.

### Who is responsible  
Accountability resolves to the **provider, deployer, or integrator** after evaluating:  
â€¢ governing policy/spec  
â€¢ environment of use  
â€¢ material impact

### Verification Levels (VL-0 â†’ VL-4)  
From uncorroborated anecdote to independently replicated and attested. The ladder yields consistent, reproducible verdictsâ€”not vibes.

ðŸŽ¯ VISUAL PLACEMENT: **Verification Ladder Dial** â€“ Place the interactive radial gauge here to let visitors explore requirements, data-quality thresholds, and economic stake for each level (VL-0 â†’ VL-4).

## The FUORI Extension (Local Review)

A locally executed extension applies FUORI criteria on **your** machineâ€”keeping sensitive context under your control.

1. **Activate** â€“ Connect logs, chats, or outputs.  
2. **Assess** â€“ Criteria run; threshold evaluated.  
3. **Report** â€“ Private timeline + impact report generated.  
4. **Extract** â€“ Minimal, de-identified slice prepared for optional public lab contribution.

### Why local-first  
Privacy, precision, and provenance. Evidence stays where it originated; only the minimum necessary metadata moves.

## Evidence Pipeline

ðŸŽ¯ VISUAL PLACEMENT: **Evidence Pipeline Flow** â€“ Inline, preceding the textual arrow below. A scroll-triggered SVG stepper animates each cryptographic stage, clarifying the journey from raw capture to tamper-evident archive.

_Capture â†’ Redact â†’ Local Review (FUORI) â†’ Private Report â†’ Anonymous Extract â†’ Public Lab â†’ Neutral Validation â†’ Archive_

* Capture & Redact â€“ PII redaction on by default.  
* Local Review â€“ Criteria applied; user-only report.  
* Anonymous Extract â€“ Minimal slices for contribution.  
* Public Lab â€“ Contributions expand the corpus; reveal pattern clusters.  
* Neutral Validation â€“ Independent operators reach consensus.  
* Archive â€“ Records sealed with integrity receipts.

---

## Neutral Validation (EigenLayer-Aligned)

To replace discretionary judgment with **verifiable consensus**, FUORI links the public lab to a restaked reviewer set:

â€¢ Independent operators replicate checks and review extracts.  
â€¢ Quorum verdicts confirm criteria satisfaction.  
â€¢ Economic incentives deter mislabeling or absenteeism.  
â€¢ Portable attestations fit audits and oversight.

_Plain English: a neutral panel with skin in the game confirms the call._

## What you get

â€¢ **Clarity** â€“ Shared definition of out-of-bounds behavior.  
â€¢ **Control** â€“ Local review; you decide what exits your device.  
â€¢ **Rigor** â€“ Verification ladder, not a comment thread.  
â€¢ **Utility** â€“ Structured reports for providers, risk teams, regulators.  
â€¢ **Transparency** â€“ Public lab views of emerging patterns.

---

## For Developers

**MCP support (Preview)**  
Query the archive from MCP-aware tools and wire the local extension into IDEs or agent stacks. Read-only endpoints are open; write paths gated to preview builds.

---

## Roadmap

â€¢ **Q4 2025** â€“ Criteria v1, FUORI extension prototype  
â€¢ **Q1 2026** â€“ Secure anonymous extract contribution  
â€¢ **Q2 2026** â€“ Neutral validation with independent quorum  
â€¢ **Q3 2026** â€“ Public dashboards, examples library, regulator-ready reporting

---

## Assurance & Privacy

â€¢ **Open provenance** â€“ C2PA-compatible metadata for every record  
â€¢ **Integrity receipts** â€“ Cryptographic hashes + audit logs  
â€¢ **Selective disclosure** â€“ Share only what's necessary  
â€¢ **Compliance-aware** â€“ Evidence tooling; not legal advice

## Elite-Tier Visual & Interactive Suggestions

1. **Dynamic Misalignment Heatmap**  
   â€¢ Animated matrix showing frequency of each category over time.  
   â€¢ Hover reveals representative, de-identified examples.

2. **Verification Ladder Dial**  
   â€¢ Circular gauge letting users explore requirements for VL-0 to VL-4.  
   â€¢ Clicking a tier surfaces methodology and sample attestations.

3. **Evidence Pipeline Flow**  
   â€¢ SVG stepper with progress animation triggered by scroll.  
   â€¢ Tooltips explain cryptographic actions at each stage.

4. **Persona Activation Explorer**  
   â€¢ Interactive activation graph (inspired by OpenAI research) displaying latent-feature spikes vs. control.  
   â€¢ Toggle between benign and misaligned persona traces.

5. **Multi-Agent Risk Simulator (lite)**  
   â€¢ Mini-sandbox where users adjust agent counts/goals and see projected misalignment scores (per sociotechnical model).  
   â€¢ Visualizes conflict probability as gradient background.

6. **Public Lab Live Feed**  
   â€¢ Real-time stream of anonymized verdicts, filterable by category, provider, or VL.  
   â€¢ Sparkline trends per category.

7. **Compliance-Ready Export Widget**  
   â€¢ Side-panel component allowing download of attestations in JSON-LD or PDF with embedded C2PA signatures.

ðŸŽ¯ VISUAL PLACEMENT: **Persona Activation Explorer** â€“ Embed within this visual suggestions section (or optionally back in Criteria after bullet 7) to illustrate the latent-feature spikes that constitute emergent persona activation, tying research to practice.

These components elevate credibility, invite exploration, and surface the science behind FUORI's approach while preserving clarity for non-experts.
